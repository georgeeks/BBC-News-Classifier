240.txt,Sport betting rules in spotlight,A group of MPs and peers has called for a tightening of regulations controlling betting on sportThe Parliamentary Group on Betting and Gaming held a substantial inquiry into betting last year It followed fears that a massive increase in betting on sport such as that done using the internet and mobile phones has led to more cheating The allparty group recommended 15 ways to protect punters and improve the integrity of sports betting They include a proposal for raising the maximum jail sentence for gambling cheats above the current two years Lord Condon head of the International Cricket Councils anticorruption unit who originally made the call for longer prison sentences said the twoyear penalty was derisory You could get a bigger sentence for failing to pay your hotel bill criminally than you could for corruption in major sports Symbolically a higher penalty perhaps as the Bill passes through the two Houses might be appropriateThe report recommended the governing bodies of sports have a say in the type of bets offered to punters and for bookmakers to set up audit trails  something the new betting exchanges already do  to allow suspicious betting patterns to be tracedLord Faulkner of Worcester who chaired the inquiry said Whilst we accept that the greater part of sports betting is neither corrupt nor unfair to punters the evidence convinces us that the growth of betting exchanges  because of the facility they provide to bet against a result  has increased the potential for corruption It is important that the government works with sporting administrators to review the difficulties faced by governing bodies in convicting the guilty and penalising them appropriately The panels aim was to try to define what constitutes cheating assess how much might be going on and suggest what the government might do to put it right As well as the growth of internet and mobile phone betting there has been the creation of betting exchanges which allow punters to fix odds between themselves Betting exchanges allow punters to back to win but also lay to lose a horse This means they can control their odds at winning by placing their money both ways,politics

050.txt,Scots smoking ban details set out,Smokefree areas will save lives and improve Scotlands health First Minister Jack McConnell has insistedHe told the Scottish Parliament on Wednesday that a comprehensive ban on smoking in public places would be introduced by the spring of 2006 Mr McConnell said the countrys health rates were lamentable not least because of smoking He said fines of up to 2500 would be levied on employers and licences would be removed for noncompliance Earlier the Scottish Executive considered a range of options but agreed unanimously to introduce an allout ban on smoking in public places In a statement to parliament Mr McConnell said that the licensed trade would be asked to join an expert committee prior to the ban coming into forceThe health arguments far outweighed lingering public disquiet about a complete ban and claims by the licensed trade that jobs would be lost he told MSPs He said there would be an international marketing campaign whereby tourists can enjoy smoke free environment and the sick man of Europe image becomes a thing of the past There are still national habits which hold us back  the time has come for this parliament to accelerate improvements in health he declared Health rates are lamentable because of a lack of exercise drugs abuse excessive drinking and overeating They all make us one of the most unhealthy countries in Europe and too many smoke It is clear that Scotland must not be held back by poor public health  the single biggest contribution devolved government can make is to reduce the toll of preventable death caused by smoking The legislation will be introduced as part of the Health Service Miscellaneous Provisions Bill which will be considered by parliament before Christmas Main points of the plan  A comprehensive ban on smoking in all enclosed public places in Scotland   The legislation will be enforced by environmental health and local licensing officers   Licensees or employers who fail to enforce the law will face fines up to a maximum of 2500   Licensees who persistently refuse to comply with the law will face the ultimate sanction of losing their liquor licence   A system of issuing fixed penalty notices for those individuals who break the law will be examined   Individuals who persistently break the law will face a maximum fine of 1000  Mr McConnell claimed there was evidence that smoking bans had helped smokers to either give up quicker or smoke less He said there had been falling cigarette sales of 13 in New York and 16 in Ireland Mr McConnell added that there had been a near nine per cent rise in tax revenues from New York bars and restaurants and in Ireland only a one point three per cent volume sales fall where they were declining before the ban The afternoon announcement following a cabinet meeting on Wednesday morning won broad support from opposition partiesThe Scottish National Partys Holyrood leader Nicola Sturgeon welcomed the move but added that the public should be consulted as the clock ticked towards the ban date She said The time has come for a ban on smoking in public places There is evidence a ban can cut deaths from passive smoking and makes it easier for the 70 of smokers who desperately want to give up the habit But we must also recognise that some people have concerns and reservations  there are people who are yet to be persuaded The Scottish Conservative Party leader David McLetchie questioned what would be exempted from the ban He was keen to know if inmates in Scottish prisons would continue to be allowed to smoke Mr McLetchie asked Would it not be ironic and perhaps entirely typical of the first ministers brave new Scotland that the criminals can be smokers but the smokers will become criminals The Scottish Green Partys health spokeswoman Eleanor Scott said she was pleased Scotland would be following the success stories of New York and Ireland She believed the majority of people in Scotland wanted to go out without having to breathe in harmful tobacco smoke,politics

112.txt,Parry firm over Gerrard,Listen to the full interview on Sport on Five and the BBC Sport website from 1900 GMTBut Parry speaking exclusively to BBC Sport also admits Gerrard who has been constantly linked with Chelsea will have the final say on his future He told BBC Five Live Steven is above money He is the future of Liverpool It doesnt matter if its 30m 40m or 50m we will not accept offers But we are also realistic enough to know we cant keep Steven against his will On the subject of Liverpools finances Parry also revealed the club is ready to explore the possibility of a sponsorship deal for its proposed new stadiumAnd responding to criticism from BBC Sport pundit and former Liverpool stalwart Alan Hansen he insisted talks on new investment are ongoing but added the door has not closed on shareholder and lifelong fan Steve Morgan Parry joined Liverpool as chief executive in July 1998 from a similar role at the Premier League There have been several highs and lows during his time in charge at Anfield  and he had a busy summer overseeing the arrival of new manager Rafael Benitez and managing to hold on to Steven GerrardOn the subject of Liverpools captain and prize asset Parry revealed Real Madriddidask for an option on the England midfield man during negotiations for striker Fernando Morientes He said They were looking for ways of saying they got more out of the deal for Fernando Morientes but the response to Real Madrid was the same  Steven is not for sale But when asked if Gerrard would be a Liverpool player on the first day of next season Parry said I sincerely hope he will be Steven knows my views He knows Rafas views We have reaffirmed recently to Steven that we are trying to build a team around him We crave success as much as he does We know hes ambitious and nobody can argue with thatI think Steven would dearly love to win things with Liverpool more than hed like to do anything else We all want to see progress by next season Hes not alone in that There are a lot of other players who feel the same so we all have a common aim It is expected Chelsea will test Liverpool with a 30mplus bid in the summer  but Parry claims he will be in no mood to listen There have been a lot of open secrets about Steven most of which have been complete myths It is suggested we had a deal tied up last summer We didnt had an offer last summer Parry explained We had told Chelsea that as far as we were concerned he was not for sale and we didnt want to sell him In reality it didnt go beyond that Maybe there will be an offer in the summer Maybe there wontOur position is we want Steven to stay but we are also realistic enough and have enough respect for Steven  and he has enough respect for us  to know that it is his decision that will be crucial You are not going to keep a player like Steven against his will That just doesnt work but any idea we are going to accept offers for Steven and then tell him by the way weve decided to sell you is not on the agenda You can forget that Parry is currently in the process of finalising funding for Liverpools new stadium in Stanley Park which is set to open in 2007 And he confessed Arsenals 100m deal with Emirates to sponsor their new ground  complete with naming rights  has given the Anfield club serious food for thought He said I have to say historically it is something I have been against and I have been on record as saying that but I think the size of the Arsenal deal is a real eyeopenerI would say in the past deals have been done frankly far too cheaply and it just hasnt even been worth contemplating But the Arsenal deal is the sort of deal that causes you to draw breath and say wow  thats interesting My personal point of view is that I would find it a hell of a lot more palatable than a shared stadium Some Liverpool fans would find such a move highly controversial but Parry countered I recognise it would be an emotive issue for many supporters but you look at the amount of money available and it could go into the team If it was the right partner how strong an issue is it Time will tell I think the stadium will always be Anfield not least because of where it is but do we need to investigate the possibilities of sponsorship I think it would be remiss not to Thats not to say we have made a decision that we will go down that road but I think it is clearly something we have to exploreOn the subject of possible new investment Parry revealed Liverpool are still in negotiations with a mystery investor with rumours of interest from the Middle East That prompted the withdrawal of tycoon Steve Morgan who got frustrated by failed bids and what he claimed was indecision by the board He also accused Liverpool of using him as a stalking horse to attract other bids but Parry explained Steve has never been used as a stalking horse Theres no need and that is not the way we do business We had discussions with Steve over the course of 2004 I think we came close to concluding a deal in the summer but it didnt happen Quite genuinely the new interest did appear relatively late in the day just prior to the AGM in December and as I have said it was of such potential magnitude and that potential is so exciting we felt we had to evaluate it We are still evaluating it Steves interest was taken very much on its own merits His enthusiasm for the club is there for all to see and who knows what the next few months will hold The door isnt closed on anything We had a perfectly sensible dialogue with Steve last year We have a common interest in making Liverpool successful Thats a dream we all share so as far as Im concerned the door is not closedI would take 50m if we had no investment but if we did keep him As for the stadium if it gets us cash what difference does it make really50m for Gerrard I dont care who you are the Directors would take the money and it is the way it should be We cannot let that sum of money go despite Gerrards qualityThrough a cleverly worded statement the club has effectively forced Gerrard to publicly make the decision for himself which I think is the right thing to doCritical time for Liverpool with regards to Gerrard Ideally we would want to secure his future to the club for the long term I am hoping he doesnt walk out of the club like Michael Owen did for very little cash50m realistically would allow Rafa to completely rebuild the squad however if we can afford to do this AND keep Gerrard we will be better for it I would however be happy with Gerrards transfer for any fee over 35mParrys statements are clever in that any future Gerrard transfer cannot be construed as a lack of ambition by the club to not try and keep their best players Upping the ante is another smart move by ParryI would keep Gerrard No amount of money could replace his obvious love of the club and determination to succeedThe key is if Gerrard comes out and says that he is happy Clearly if he isnt then we would

358.txt,What price for 'trusted PC security'?,You can now buy trusted computers but can we really trust the PC vendors asks technology analyst Bill ThompsonIf you have recently bought an IBM ThinkVantage computer a Dell Optiplex or one of a whole range of laptops from Toshiba HPCompaq or Samsung then you may have got more for your money than you realised Inside your shiny new PC is an extra chip called the trusted platform module TPM that can be used for a range of hardwarebased security features Eventually the TPM will be built into the main processor itself and if the trusted computing group has its way then you will find one in every piece of hardware you own from mobile phones to TV set top boxes to childrens toys But for the moment it is a separate piece of hardware providing enhanced security features to programs that know how to use them And as part of a welldesigned network system it can provide a lot more security than we enjoy today A big advantage of the TPM is that it is hardwarebasedAt the moment most of us rely on software to keep our information safe and secure It might be passwordprotected user accounts data encryption programs or a firewall but it all relies on program code running on an inherently insecure processorHardware security is less common even if it is a lot safer This is partly because it is more expensive to give someone a smartcard than a password but also because its more work for users systems administrators and managers As a result we settle for second best So when it comes to computer security trusted systems could be a major step forward After all if you have a laptop that will only run programs that have been digitally signed then it will be a lot harder for virus writers to get their malicious code to run And if all your files are locked automatically then even if you get your computer stolen your personal data will be safeguarded At the moment support for trusted hardware is not built into major operating systems Instead you have to use special software like HPs ProtectTools or Wave Systems Embassy This provides file encryption password management and identity protection usually for business users who connect to company networks Full support for the trusted computing specification will not be available from Microsoft until the next release of Windows Longhorn This will include what Microsoft in a typical act of obscurantism calls the Next Generation Secure Computing Base and it will give userlevel programs access to the trusted computing hardware When that happens we can expect to see a lot of publicity around the new capabilities and no doubt the Windows security centre will encourage users to turn on their trusted computing capability just as they turn on their firewall However there is a downside to the increased security from viruses spyware and data theft that this will provideBecause the trusted computing base is also used to make digital rights management DRM systems more secure this will give content providers a lot more control over what we can do with music movies and books that we have bought from them We have seen recently how allowing digital rights management services into our lives can lead to unwelcome consequences Users of Apples iTunes used to be able to stream the music they had brought to up to five other iTunes users a great way of letting your mates discover your music collectionBut the latest version of iTunes limits this capability just as an earlier upgrade reduced the number of times you could burn a selected playlist of purchased songs to a CD Another took away the ability to play songs downloaded from Reals Harmony service on your iPod Apple can do this because they wrote the software and they control the rights management Once it is embedded in trusted hardware it will be even harder for dedicated programmers to find their way around these restrictions and give us back the fair use rights that should be guaranteed under copyright law Similarly users of TiVo digital video recorders have found that they cannot record some shows and other programmes that they have recorded are automatically deleted after a day This happens because of changes that TiVo have made to their software and the users cannot control it One wonders whether hardwarebased DRM will work for those who believe that lockingdown digital content is a bad idea and that the flexibility of copyright law is something that should be embraced and not taken away It will not work because of the fundamental flaw at the heart of the system in order for the purchaser to view the content it has to be unlocked Once it is unlocked then someone somewhere will figure out a way to make a copy of the unlocked version And once an unlocked version leaks onto the network it will be uncontrollable The efforts going into DRM would be much better spent building efficient distribution services finding business models that are based on trusting your customers and offering high quality downloads at fair prices What we want is not so much a trusted computing platform as a trusted customer platform The record companies and the film industry need to recognise that most of us most of the time will pay a reasonable amount for good quality material They will benefit more by building a market in which I can share songs with my friends record shows I want to watch later and burn CDs for my kids a market which respects the spirit of copyright law and does not seek to replace it by restrictive contracts or end user agreements We need to ensure that trusted computing remains under the control of the users and is not used to take away the freedoms we enjoy todayBill Thompson is a regular commentator on the BBC World Service programme Go Digital,tech

256.txt,Brits debate over 'urban' music,Joss Stone a 17yearold soul singer from Devon beat Dizzee Rascal Jamelia Lemar and The Streets to win best British urban act at the Brit Awards Her victory has reignited the debate about what urban music isIm not really comfortable with the word urban Its a word thats been manufactured in this country and America to describe black music The word urban seems to cover such a broad range of black music that its wrong How far are the Brits removed from innercity music and what people are doing Its so far removed that I dont expect them to get it bang on The music industry isnt championing music from our particular genre very well anyway People dont feel like thats anything to do with us I dont feel like urban musics just been celebrated by [Joss Stone] winning or her being nominated or by the Brits acknowledging that theres an urban music scene because its all a kick in the teeth at the end of the day Its not really relevant If Joss Stone is the closest thing that they feel comfortable championing because of what she looks like and how she sounds and who shes signed to then so be it Its got nothing to do with whats really going onUrban as a genre is very broad If you look underneath urban there are a number of core elements that include hiphop RB garage and into that obviously comes soul Joss Stone is a soul artist Her first album was called The Soul Sessions So urban is a very broad brushstroke that is the umbrella over the top of subgenres and there are offshoots of all of those Joss Stone has had amazing success [in the US] given that shes a UK artist What has really captured everybodys imagination is that here you have a 17yearold from Devon with a voice to die for and a bunch of really really good tunes and she looks good  I think thats whats done itThe award for best British urban act was voted for by viewers of MTV BaseI dont think Joss was not a worthy winner She makes soul music and that definitely comes under the category of what we describe as urban The fact that shes from Devon is the interesting thing because most of the music we cover is made in large cities and shes literally rural The great thing about urban music is that theres a big range If there is some sort of root with black music or dance music in Britain I think thats where you can call it urban  thats where this new subcategory or ubercategory has come from Joss Stone is certainly not old enough to have had some of the experiences of an older soul singer but you couldnt argue that she was being inauthentic with her emotions  it is coming from somewhere genuine It has to come across as real Thats the only cutoff point we have here and thats the only way by which we judge peopleWhat urban means to us as an organisation is the politically correct term to describe music which originated from a black background Music should become inclusive and if we are fighting for a multicultural Britain then we should be fighting for inclusion rather than exclusion If Joss Stone can be accepted within the urban music community I think acts from other ethnicities doing classical music and rock should be accepted too Race doesnt make a difference if everyone is included Out of all the awards dished out yesterday Im still trying to find out what people of other races received any sort of recognition or awardA type of music especially street music that originates from a city and typically reflects or is characteristic of urban lifeShe might not be urban but when did RB become the hip hop tainted thing it is now RB stands for Rhythm And Blues rememberThat Joss Stone is rubbish is certain If anyone deserves to win an award for urban music I think probably should include HipHop Soul  Funk at least but not rock or pop this year its the Streets although Dizzee Rascal stakes a good claimShe definitely deserved to win a prize Joss Stones albums are quite simply amazing easily better than anything else that was released last year This whole debate about what is urban what isnt urban is completely pointless and probably fueled by urban artists who werent nominated or didnt win I cant see why people cant just congratulate her for the talent that she isShe did deserve it but I agree with the comments about urban music Its a stupid phrase and particularly British In the states they tend to use hip hop and RB if I say hip hop here a lot of people have no idea what Im talking about Very strangeWhats in a name A rose by any other name etc If people want to call it urban why not If we really analysed it the term dance music is misleading because it doesnt describe everything you can dance toWhilst I agree that the term urban is open to interpretation it strikes me as simply weird that Joss Stone has won Urban to me is what I hear being played in parties in the inner cities  I live in Brixton and have never heard The Soul Sessions pumping out of of a bass heavy sound system in any parties Ive been to Good luck to Joss Stone lets celebrate her victory  lets also question why with artists so successful and talented as Jamelia Lemar Kanye West Dizzee Rascal Alicia Keys and Outkast  we didnt see a single black artist on stage collecting an awardSo what youre saying is that any music that has black heritage is not allowed to be sung by anyone who isnt black And if it is then they shouldnt be acknowledged for it even if theyre pretty dam good at it Shes 17 has an amazing voice and won Good on her Oh but shes not black well lets make her feel real bad about it then How dare she Though hang on didnt the socalled public vote on this oneThis idea of pigeonholing whatever is popular at the time is no different than what was happening in the 1940s and 50s in relation to what Jazz was The media then called anything that had a swinging beat syncopated melody or soulful feeling Jazz much to the chagrin of the artists It would mean that blues would be put in the same mould as bebop cool and ragtime all very different styles at that time Jazz was and remains such a massively misunderstood term And so what of Urban music In truth its a lazy term to categorise music that you dont really understand Soul and garage are worlds apart musically Marvin Gaye v Tuff Jam but no doubt have their connections If we just let the music speak for itself and not judge the success of an artist by the number of awards won then maybe we can enjoy the music for what it is rather than what it representsI demand a prize for rural music Sucks to the cities its way better out here We have hay for one thingExcluding her from what has become known as urban music would be as bad as excluding Lenny Kravitz or Hendrix from rock music for being black surely I dont understand the point that Ty is making If Lemar who makes music which is less soulful than Joss work won he might have said nothing btw im black tooHow can she be urban if she spent most of her life in the Devon countryside NonsenseI love Joss to bits and dont care what her branding is  its amazing music full stop Stop puting it all in brackets and lets just call it music and lets especially drop the black  urban tag  nearly all music came from black origin this just sets an example that it is ok to pigeonhole people and their music by their colourSurely the point of having an urban music category is simply to acknowledge artists that are making what is historically considered urban music irrelevent of the colour of their skin or where they originate from Joss Stone is simply singing a certain type of music that can be considered urban in style just as someone from an inner city and indeed not from the USA could sing country music If that person was good at it and authentic in sound would we criticise it being referred to as country music or the artist for representing that styleThe term urban in reference to a music genre in UK has developed in part from the controversy surrounding the branding of the MOBO Awards The very term Music of Black Origin has confused and offended many people This is particularly strange given the existence of the Asian Music Awards It appears that the use of black or white in relation to music makes people feel uncomfortable The term urban therefore has been invoked to sidestep the debate of which type of music came first black or white thereby rendering the issue colourblind The result is now a redundant new debate as to what urban also means Perhaps we should have created a new term altogether to describe the various strains of soulRnB and HipHop one which does not also mean something else  as we have done with CrunkUrban is just a word thats come about recently to describe black music thats become popular now The word wasnt even in use or common use five of six years ago Its just a way of the industry clumping it all together without having to call it black music because some people are oversensitive and might call them racist for itIm in a band that has been called urban and I despise the label Id hate to think I belonged to any neat marketing niche because thats all it is Ever since the music channels and record comapnies tried to fracture what they consider music of black origin these labels have been used to undermine the status of good music into a commodity Look at all the TV broadcasters unable to reach young people without condesending they simply play some urban music on the soundtrack as if its some dreadful cheap lift music Ignore the labels it is what it is just musicAs a black man I think I agree with some of the statements at least the statements made by the key executives Black people should lead the music they invented  We should stop calling a genre meaningless northing is meaningless The real question is would Joss Stone would have been that successful doing the music she was doing if she were black Same thing with Streets Amy Winehouse etc Whos ever heard of Terri Walker or Rhian Benson They are both 10 times better than Joss Stone and both of them have won Urban Music Awards and i think Mobos  but why not BritsSo what if Joss Stone won the Urban awards Her music is great soul and surely that is under the Urban banner What if The Streets had won Would people be whining because Mike Skinner is white It seems that a lot of the fuss is about race where the real issue should be music and nothing elseUrban is PC version for saying black music Im not doubting Ms Stones talent but why didnt Jamelia or Lemar get a Brit This reminds me of what happened to Craig David and Soul II Soul in the past getting nominations are easy to get but picking up a Brit seems to be the hardest thingRefreshing to see people making reasonable intelligent comments on any topic these days More power to you people You have said it there is music you like and music you dont like  who cares what label you put on itThat entire category was a mess How can you have people like Dizzee Rascal up against Joss Stone Its like putting Eminem against Bob Geldof She should have been nominated for Best British R  B act Joss Stone deserved to win an award for her talents but I dont think it was very urban of her to sing angels with Robbie WilliamsUrban is a nonsense term  music of black origin Well doesnt that include rock Music made in the inner cities Well almost all bands end up making music in LondonManchester etc And doesnt that make some weird implication that all black people live in cities It doesnt make any senseWhy does music have to be put into a genre Its music you like it or you dont Simple as thatI play in a heavy metal band We are urban music as far as Im concerned We live in cities and spend our working life in an urban environment It therefore directly shapes what we write musicallyUrban seems to be the new name for all styles of black music Why it needed a rebrand I dont know as the name is misleading Oasis originate from a city and characterise the urban life they know therefore more than fit the term urban yet as theyre a white rock band they wont be described as suchJoss Stone has a fantastic voice and great timing and delivery  what other reason do they need to award her the Brit All this urban and other such categorisation is just the redtape of the music business and is best ignoredYeah she deserved it She is talented Urban is a crap meaningless politically correct and probably actually racist marketing term though Theres only two kinds of music good and bad,entertainment

047.txt,Student 'fee factor' played down,A rise has been recorded in the number of students from south of the border applying to universities in ScotlandHowever Lifelong Learning Minister Jim Wallace said that this would not result in Scottish students missing out Applications from England and Wales rose by 17 between January 2005 and the previous year up 23600 to 27700 Fears had been expressed that a flood of fee refugees would try to avoid topup fees of up to 3000 a year being introduced in England In June last year Mr Wallace announced proposals to increase tuition fees for English students studying in Scotland by 2000 in an attempt to prevent a crossborder flood although no figure has yet been agreed Legislation to introduce the topup fees in England is not due to take effect until autumn 2006 and students who start before then will not have to pay additional fees at allThe figures were made public on Thursday by admissions service Ucas Universities Scotland which represents university principals claimed that an increase in applications did not amount to Scottish students being squeezed out Director David Caldwell said some students could be applying in an attempt to avoid the possible increase in annual fees at English universities but this was not a major factor He told BBC Radio Scotlands Good Morning Scotland programme The reason people are opting for Scottish universities is that they are perceived as being of very high quality they offer very attractive courses and Scotland is seen as a very attractive place to studyThey know that when they take up their studies in 2006 they will be hit by topup fees if they are going to a university in England and that may be part of the reason why the numbers coming to Scotland are so inflated However it does not mean that we will see thousands of additional students from England studying here Mr Wallace agreed and said the figures had to be looked at in context He explained that when applications were translated into acceptances the number was not huge  an additional figure of about 200Also the picture was further blurred by the fact that applications from Wales where there are no plans for topup fees have also risen by 19 Mr Wallace said Accepting students from all parts of the world does show the high regard in which Scottish higher education is held not just in Britain We want to make sure that when students are making their choice they do so on the nature of the course and not because they are under some sort of financial pressure to go to Scotland We do not want to have a situation where it becomes impossible for Scottish students to get places at Scottish universities because we are seen as the cheap option Very often the quality of the university experience is enhanced by the fact there are students coming from a wide range of backgrounds so it would be wrong to go the other way and start excluding students,politics

277.txt,Turkey turns on the economic charm,Three years after a gruelling economic crisis Turkey has dressed its economy to impressAs part of a charm offensive  ahead of 17 December when the European Union will decide whether to start entry talks  Turkeys economic leaders have been banging the drum to draw attention to recent achievements The economy is growing fast they insist Education levels among its young and large population are rising Unemployment levels in percentage terms are heading fast towards single digits Inflation is under control A new law to govern its turbulent banking system is on the cards The tourism industry is booming and revenues from visitors should more than double to 21bn 108bn in three yearsMoreover government spending is set to be frozen and a burdensome social security deficit is being tackled Income and corporate taxes will be cut next year in order to attract 15bn of foreign investment over the next three years A loan restructuring deal with the International Monetary Fund IMF is pretty much in the can And following recent macroeconomic restructuring efforts its currency is floating freely and its central bank is independentThe point of all this has been to convince Europes decision makers that rather than being a phenomenally costly exercise for the EU allowing Turkey in would in fact bring masses of economic benefitsThe cake will be bigger for everybody said Deputy Prime Minister Abdullatif Sener earlier this month Turkey will not be a burden for the EU budget If admitted into the EU Turkey would contribute almost 6bn euros 8bn 6bn to its budget by 2014 according to a recent impact study by the countrys State Planning Organisation As Turkeys gross domestic output GDP is set to grow by 6 per year on average its contribution would rise from less than 5bn euros in 2014 to almost 9bn euros by 2020 Turkey could also help alleviate a labour shortage in Old Europe once its population comes of age By 2014 one in four Turks  or about 18 million people  will be aged 14 or less A literate and qualified Turkish population insisted Mr Sener will make a positive impact on the EUThis runs contrary to the popular view that Turkey is getting ready to dig deep into EU taxpayers wallets However Turkeys assertions are confirmed by Brussels own impact studies which indeed say that Turkish membership would be good news for the EU economy But only over time Costs are projected to be vast during the early years of Turkeys membership with subsidies alone estimated to exceed 165bn euros and according to some predictions balloon to 335bn euros This would include vast agricultural subsidies and regional aid though such payments should decline as the countrys farm sector which currently employs one in three Turks would employ just one in five by 2020Such high initial expenses would be coupled with risks that the benefits flagged up by Turkeys government would never be delivered say those who feel the Turkish project should be shunnedSome fear that rather than providing an educated sophisticated labour force for Europe at large the people who will leave Turkey to seek work abroad will be poor uneducated  and plentiful More recently less palatable concerns  at least in liberal European circles  have been voiced with senior EU or member state officials talking darkly of a river of Islam an oriental culture and a threat to Europes cultural richness Of course many opponents are politically motivated  their views ranging from xenophobic prejudices about the countrys Muslim traditions to welldocumented concerns about the governments human rights record Yet their economic arguments should not be dismissed out of handCritics insist that much of the optimism about Turkeys economic roadmap has been overegged  an argument amplified by a 134 rise in the countrys current account deficit to 107bn during the first 10 months of this yearThe countrys massive debt  which includes 23bn owed to the IMF and billions borrowed via the international bond markets  also remains a major obstacle to its ambition of joining the EU In the new member states of the European Union gross public debt is typically about 40 of gross domestic product says Reza Moghadam assistant director of the IMFs European Department At about 80 of GDP Turkeys gross debt is double that figure Turkeys debts have largely arisen from its efforts to push through banking reform after a run on the banks in 2001 caused the countrys devastating recession There is no question that although Turkey is doing much better than in the past it remains quite vulnerable says Michael Deppler director of the IMFs European Department Its debt is far too high for an emerging economy A key factor for EU decision makers should be whether or not Turkey has met its economic criteria But economics is not a science And although the state of Turkeys economy is important as is its pace of reform the final decision on 17 December will be taken by politicians who will of course be guided by their political instincts,business
