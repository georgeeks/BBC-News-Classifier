135.txt,GTA sequel is criminally good,The Grand Theft Auto series of games have set themselves the very highest of standards in recent years but the newest addition is more than able to live up to an increasingly grand traditionThe 18 certificate GTA San Andreas for the PlayStation 2 could have got away with merely revisiting a bestselling formula with a moreofthesame approach Instead it builds and expands almost immeasurably upon the last two games and stomps carefree over all the Driv3r and True Crimeshaped opposition Even in the year that will see sequels to Halo and HalfLife it is hard to envisage anything topping this barnstorming instant classicThe basic gameplay remains familiar You control a character on this occasion a youth named CJ who sets out on a series of selfcontained missions within a massive 3D environment CJ can commandeer any vehicle he stumbles across from a pushbike to a city bus to a plane All come in handy as he seeks to establish his presence in a tough urban environment and avenge the dreadful deeds waged upon his family To make things worse he is framed for murder the moment he arrives in town and blackmailed by crooked cops played by Samuel L Jackson and Chris Penn The setting for all this rampant criminality is the fictional US state of San Andreas comprising three major cities Los Santos which is a thinlydisguised Los Angeles San Fierro aka San Francisco and Las Venturas a carbon copy of Las Vegas San Andreas sucks you in with its sprawling range cast of characters and incredibly sharp writingIts ability to capture the ambience of the realworld versions of these cities is something to behold assisted no end by the monumental graphical advances since Vice City The streets and vast swathes of countryside are by turns gloriously menacing grungy and preppy Flaunting awesome levels of graphical detail the games overall look particularly during the many unusual weather conditions and dramatic sunsets is stupendous The outstanding breadandbutter gameplay mechanics provide a solid grounding for the elaborate plot to hang on Cars handle more convincingly than ever a superb motion blur kicks in when you hit high speeds and theres more traffic to navigate than before Park your vehicle across the lanes of a freeway and within seconds there will be a huge pileup Pedestrians are also out in force and are a loquacious bunch CJ can interact with them using a simple system on the control pad They will pass comments on his appearance and credibility aspects that the player now has control over Clothes tattoos and haircuts can all be purchased and funding these habits can be achieved by criminal means or by indulging in minigames like betting on horses and challenging bar patrons to games of pool The character will put on or lose weight according to how long he spends on foot or in the gym He will have to pause regularly in restaurants to keep energy levels up but will swell up as a result of overeating And at last this is a GTA hero who can swimAt a time when games are once again under fire for their supposed potential to corrupt the young San Andreas violence or specifically the freedom it gives the player to commit violence are sure to inflame the procensorship brigade Developers Rockstar have not shied away from brutality and in some respects ramp it up from past outingsWhen hijacking a car for example CJ will gratuitously shove the drivers head into the steering wheel rather than just fleeing with the vehicle Indeed the tone is darker than the jokey Vice City The grim subject matter here hardly lends itself to gags in quite the same way as the cheesy 80s setting of the last game This title incidentally is set in 1992 but that is really neither here nor there apart from the influence it has on the radio playlists The wit is still present just more restrained than in previous outings A further reason for this is that the incredible range of invehicle radio stations available means you will spend less time happening upon the hilarious talk radio options where GTA games trademark humour is anchored The quality of voice acting and motion capture is simply offthechart The games rather odious gangland lowlifes swagger and mouth off in a way that rings very true indeed It is a testament to San Andreas magnificence that it has a number of prominent flaws but pluspoints are so numerous that the niggles dont detract The onscreen map for instance is needlessly fiddly an unwelcome change from past editions There is also a very jarring slowdown at actionpacked moments And the game suffers from the ageold problem that can be relied upon to blight all games of this genre setting you back a vast distance when you fail right at the very end of a long mission But the gameplay experience in its entirety is overwhelmingly positive You simply will not be bothered by these minor failings San Andreas is among the few unmissable games of 2004,tech

050.txt,Scots smoking ban details set out,Smokefree areas will save lives and improve Scotlands health First Minister Jack McConnell has insistedHe told the Scottish Parliament on Wednesday that a comprehensive ban on smoking in public places would be introduced by the spring of 2006 Mr McConnell said the countrys health rates were lamentable not least because of smoking He said fines of up to 2500 would be levied on employers and licences would be removed for noncompliance Earlier the Scottish Executive considered a range of options but agreed unanimously to introduce an allout ban on smoking in public places In a statement to parliament Mr McConnell said that the licensed trade would be asked to join an expert committee prior to the ban coming into forceThe health arguments far outweighed lingering public disquiet about a complete ban and claims by the licensed trade that jobs would be lost he told MSPs He said there would be an international marketing campaign whereby tourists can enjoy smoke free environment and the sick man of Europe image becomes a thing of the past There are still national habits which hold us back  the time has come for this parliament to accelerate improvements in health he declared Health rates are lamentable because of a lack of exercise drugs abuse excessive drinking and overeating They all make us one of the most unhealthy countries in Europe and too many smoke It is clear that Scotland must not be held back by poor public health  the single biggest contribution devolved government can make is to reduce the toll of preventable death caused by smoking The legislation will be introduced as part of the Health Service Miscellaneous Provisions Bill which will be considered by parliament before Christmas Main points of the plan  A comprehensive ban on smoking in all enclosed public places in Scotland   The legislation will be enforced by environmental health and local licensing officers   Licensees or employers who fail to enforce the law will face fines up to a maximum of 2500   Licensees who persistently refuse to comply with the law will face the ultimate sanction of losing their liquor licence   A system of issuing fixed penalty notices for those individuals who break the law will be examined   Individuals who persistently break the law will face a maximum fine of 1000  Mr McConnell claimed there was evidence that smoking bans had helped smokers to either give up quicker or smoke less He said there had been falling cigarette sales of 13 in New York and 16 in Ireland Mr McConnell added that there had been a near nine per cent rise in tax revenues from New York bars and restaurants and in Ireland only a one point three per cent volume sales fall where they were declining before the ban The afternoon announcement following a cabinet meeting on Wednesday morning won broad support from opposition partiesThe Scottish National Partys Holyrood leader Nicola Sturgeon welcomed the move but added that the public should be consulted as the clock ticked towards the ban date She said The time has come for a ban on smoking in public places There is evidence a ban can cut deaths from passive smoking and makes it easier for the 70 of smokers who desperately want to give up the habit But we must also recognise that some people have concerns and reservations  there are people who are yet to be persuaded The Scottish Conservative Party leader David McLetchie questioned what would be exempted from the ban He was keen to know if inmates in Scottish prisons would continue to be allowed to smoke Mr McLetchie asked Would it not be ironic and perhaps entirely typical of the first ministers brave new Scotland that the criminals can be smokers but the smokers will become criminals The Scottish Green Partys health spokeswoman Eleanor Scott said she was pleased Scotland would be following the success stories of New York and Ireland She believed the majority of people in Scotland wanted to go out without having to breathe in harmful tobacco smoke,politics

395.txt,Paris promise raises Welsh hopes,Has there been a better Six Nations match than Saturdays epic in ParisAnd can the Welsh revival continue all the way to a first Grand Slam since 1978 Those are the two questions occupying not just Wales supporters but rugby fans as a whole after a scintillating display in Paris Welsh legend Mervyn Davies a member of two of three Grand Slamwinning sides of the 1970s hailed it as one of the great performances of the past three decades Martyn Williams Wales twotry scorer on the day called it one of the most surreal games I have ever played in A crestfallen France coach Bernard Laporte simply observed There was a French half and there was a Welsh half And what a half it was for the Red Dragonhood transforming a 156 halftime deficit into an 1815 lead within five mesmerising minutes of the second period But while that passage of play showed the swelling selfbelief of a side prepared to back its own spirit of adventure the final quarter told us a whole lot more about this Welsh side That they recovered from a battering in the first halfhour to first stem the tide before halftime then reverse it on the resumption was remarkable enough But in resisting a seemingly unstoppable wave of French pressure in a nailbiting final five minutes Wales showed not only their physical attributes but their mental resolveIn international rugby any of the top seven sides can beat each other on a given day but the great sides are those that win the close contests on a consistent basis England suffered some infamous Six Nations disappointments en route to World Cup glory the pain of defeat forging bonds that ultimately led to victory when it really mattered Wales have some way to go before they can be remotely considered in a similar light But the signs are that players previously on the receiving end are learning how to emerge on the right side of the scoreline Ten of the 22 on duty on Saturday were also involved when Wales were trounced 335 in Paris two years ago But since they threw off the shackles against New Zealand in the 2003 World Cup Wales have rediscovered much of what made them a great rugby nation in the first placeThe confidence in the squad has been building and building since the World Cup and we now have young players who are becoming world class noted coach Mike Ruddock The likes of Michael Owen Gethin Jenkins Dwayne Peel and Gavin Henson are certainly building strong cases for inclusion on this summers Lions tour to New Zealand And players like Stephen Jones Martyn Williams Shane Williams and Gareth Thomas are proving it is not only the youngsters that are on an upward curve Jones after his superb manofthematch display observed that we are a very happy camp now Ruddock and Thomas can take much of the credit for that ensuring the tribal and regional divisions that have often scarred Welsh rugby do not extend to the national squad Thejoie de vivreso evident in that magical secondhalf spell in Paris also stems from a style of play that first wooed supporters the world over in the 1970sIf England had half the innate attacking exuberance Wales have produced in this championship they would not be contemplating the debris of three consecutive defeats Similarly Wales have learnt that style alone does not win matches and that forward power mental toughness and good decisionmaking under pressure are equally important So on to Murrayfield where Wales have not won on their last three visits While the hype in the Principality will go into overdrive the players will set about the task of beating Scotland Only then  with the visit of Ireland to finish  can they start thinking about emulating the hallowed players of the 1970s and writing their own names into Welsh legend,sports

International Monetary Fund IMF is pretty much in the can And following recent macroeconomic restructuring efforts its currency is floating freely and its central bank is independentThe point of all this has been to convince Europes decision makers that rather than being a phenomenally costly exercise for the EU allowing Turkey in would in fact bring masses of economic benefitsThe cake will be bigger for everybody said Deputy Prime Minister Abdullatif Sener earlier this month Turkey will not be a burden for the EU budget If admitted into the EU Turkey would contribute almost 6bn euros 8bn 6bn to its budget by 2014 according to a recent impact study by the countrys State Planning Organisation As Turkeys gross domestic output GDP is set to grow by 6 per year on average its contribution would rise from less than 5bn euros in 2014 to almost 9bn euros by 2020 Turkey could also help alleviate a labour shortage in Old Europe once its population comes of age By 2014 one in four Turks  or about 18 million people  will be aged 14 or less A literate and qualified Turkish population insisted Mr Sener will make a positive impact on the EUThis runs contrary to the popular view that Turkey is getting ready to dig deep into EU taxpayers wallets However Turkeys assertions are confirmed by Brussels own impact studies which indeed say that Turkish membership would be good news for the EU economy But only over time Costs are projected to be vast during the early years of Turkeys membership with subsidies alone estimated to exceed 165bn euros and according to some predictions balloon to 335bn euros This would include vast agricultural subsidies and regional aid though such payments should decline as the countrys farm sector which currently employs one in three Turks would employ just one in five by 2020Such high initial expenses would be coupled with risks that the benefits flagged up by Turkeys government would never be delivered say those who feel the Turkish project should be shunnedSome fear that rather than providing an educated sophisticated labour force for Europe at large the people who will leave Turkey to seek work abroad will be poor uneducated  and plentiful More recently less palatable concerns  at least in liberal European circles  have been voiced with senior EU or member state officials talking darkly of a river of Islam an oriental culture and a threat to Europes cultural richness Of course many opponents are politically motivated  their views ranging from xenophobic prejudices about the countrys Muslim traditions to welldocumented concerns about the governments human rights record Yet their economic arguments should not be dismissed out of handCritics insist that much of the optimism about Turkeys economic roadmap has been overegged  an argument amplified by a 134 rise in the countrys current account deficit to 107bn during the first 10 months of this yearThe countrys massive debt  which includes 23bn owed to the IMF and billions borrowed via the international bond markets  also remains a major obstacle to its ambition of joining the EU In the new member states of the European Union gross public debt is typically about 40 of gross domestic product says Reza Moghadam assistant director of the IMFs European Department At about 80 of GDP Turkeys gross debt is double that figure Turkeys debts have largely arisen from its efforts to push through banking reform after a run on the banks in 2001 caused the countrys devastating recession There is no question that although Turkey is doing much better than in the past it remains quite vulnerable says Michael Deppler director of the IMFs European Department Its debt is far too high for an emerging economy A key factor for EU decision makers should be whether or not Turkey has met its economic criteria But economics is not a science And although the state of Turkeys economy is important as is its pace of reform the final decision on 17 December will be taken by politicians who will of course be guided by their political instincts,business

264.txt,Blair looks to election campaign,Tony Blairs big speech will be looked back on as the performance that kicked off the election campaignThat poll may still be about 16 weeks away but there can be little doubt left that the campaign is now in full swing The prime minister used his speech to a selected audience in the south east to set out his broad brush election manifesto There was a detailed account of the governments past record with a major emphasis on the economy and public services There was an attempt to draw the line under the gossip surrounding his rift with Chancellor Gordon Brown And there was an insistence on the importance of the party continuing to operate as unremittingly New Labour  although that may continue to irritate his chancellorThere was little in terms of concrete proposals or what might form manifesto pledges although the prime minister talked about a New Labour manifesto that will be aimed at all sections of society His was more a speech designed to remind people and some in his own party precisely what New Labour stood for and to leave them in no doubt there would not be any shrinking away from that approach And for some that means showing that New Labour actually does stand for something  that it is as he said more than an electoral deviceTo that end he set out a broad programme aimed to appeal to both middle England voters who switched to the party in 1997 and stuck with it possibly through some gritted teeth in 2001 and to more traditional lower income old Labour supporters In a key section he declared In our third term we can achieve an unprecedented widening of opportunity and prosperity For the first time ever a whole generation growing up with unbroken economic stability Every family  not just the fortunate few  knowing their children will have an inheritance at adulthood Every pupil in every secondary school guaranteed a place in university or a quality apprenticeship Every adult  including those who missed out at school  able to get the skills then need to advance Home ownership extended to its highest ever level and to families who have never before been able to afford it The highest ever level of employment with everyone in work guaranteed a decent wage and decent conditionsUnder what is to be the general election slogan Britain is working the prime minister time and again insisted the future direction would be unremittingly New Labour That might get under the skin of Mr Brown but he also heaped praise on him as the most successful postwar chancellor Britain has had Probably the greatest ideological divide between the two men in so far as there is one is about the degree of private finance allowed into the public servicesAn unremittingly New Labour manifesto as the prime minister is happy to make plain will stress the importance of that  the belief patients and parents for example want a choice of good services before they start worrying about who has provided them The chancellor is said to be far more sceptical about private finance although there is no suggestion he opposes it in principle With an election looming the next big speech from Gordon Brown will be closely examined for any signs of divisions and in particular the use of that little three letter word But for now all eyes have been focused on the next general election And for many in Westminster Mr Blairs performance has only succeeded in hardening the belief that will be on 5 May,politics

119.txt,Time to get tough on friendlies?,For an international manager a friendly provides an important opportunity to work with your playersThe only problem is that the game itself can often be a farce Some people have been saying it would be better to get the players together for the week and do away with the 90 minutes at the endI would say its 5050 whether you should have these games or not and if you look at it that way you would probably say youre better not doing so It would certainly keep club managers happy as it would reduce the risk of players returning to domestic duty injured But international bosses will tell you that scrapping friendlies is counterproductive because the only way for a team to get better is by playing The more you play together the easier it is when it comes to the crunch in games like World Cup quarterfinals against Brazil Often in friendlies though a manager will play his strongest side for the first 45 minutes and then send out an entirely different one in the second half And its very difficult for any player to come on as substitute in a side with a few changes let alone a whole teams worth The debate will rage on and Im not sure there is a satisfactory solution One manager who has got it right this week is Walter Smith The new Scotland manager has decided to have a training camp instead of a friendly for his first international week since replacing Berti Vogts It is the sort of move you would expect from Walter who is a canny managerThe players have had such a hard time recently that he is better off getting them together in a relaxed atmosphere and trying to generate some team spirit before the next World Cup qualifiers If he had sent them out on Wednesday and they had been badly beaten it would have done them no good whatsoever John Toshack has his first game in charge of Wales and it will be important for him to get a decent result against Hungary He will have his own ideas on individuals and how to play and will probably look more at the performance but the public wants results Its extremely difficult to get the balance for friendlies If you win people forget them but if you lose it becomes a stat that can be used against you Englands game against Holland is a good example It looks like a good opportunity to try out players like Middlesbrough winger Stewart Downing or Crystal Palace striker Andy Johnson But you have got to remember SvenGoran Erikssons side were given a lesson by Spain in the last game they playedThe injury problems in defence should at least give the likes of Wes Brown and Jamie Carragher a chance to impress For the club managers it will simply be a case of waiting at home with fingers crossed,sports
